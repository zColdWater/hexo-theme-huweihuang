A: Do you have any sweet apples?

A: Okay, would you give me three pounds,please?
B: Of course.
A: How long do they stay fresh?
B: In a refrigerator, they should stay fresh for a couple of weeks.
   But don't keep them in a warm place.
   I can't guarantee they'll stay juicy then, and anything else?
