    语法介绍:  
    1.We usually put adverbials of frequency in `front` of the main verb:  
    We `often` spend Christmas with friends.  
    I have `never` enjoyed myself so much.  

    2.They usually come `after` the verb be:  
    He was `always` tired in the evening.  
    We are `never` late for work.

    3.We use the adverbial `a lot` to mean `often` or `frequently`. It comes at the end of the clause:  
    We go to the cinema `a lot`.  

    4.`Before` another time adverbial:  
    We go to the cinema `a lot` at the weekend.  

    5.We use `much` with a `negative` to mean not often:  
    We don’t go out much. (= We don’t go out often)  

    6.We use `how often` or ever to ask questions about `frequency`. `How often` comes at the `beginning` of the clause:   
    `How often` do you go to the cinema?  
    `How often` have you been here?  

    7.`Ever` comes `before` the main verb:  
    Do you `ever` go to the cinema at the weekend?  
    Have you `ever` been there?  

    8.Longer frequency phrases, like `every year` or `three times a day` usually come at the end of the clause:  
    I have an English lesson `twice a week`.  
    She goes to see her mother `every day`.
